# Beef Curry

Adapted from Naomi Duguid's pretty excellent _River's of Flavor_. 

##  Ingredients
* 2.5 lbs beef, cut into chunks
* 1.5 tbsp garam masala
* 1 tbsp paprika
* 1 tbsp red chile pepper or flakes
* .5 tbsp black pepper
* 3 cloves garlic
* 3 tbsp ginger
* 2 tbsp salt
* 1 cups sliced, fried shallots (see note)
* 6 small shallots, peeled
* .25 cup neutral oil
* .5 tbsp Vietnamese fish sauce, plus more for serving
* .25 cup water

## Optional
* Potatoes, cut into smallish chunks, added a little before you add the whole shallots and pretty common, and can help thicken if necessary.
* Cauliflower chunks work well.
* Tomatoes can add a nice acid to cut through the fatty richness of the dish.
* Eggs.


## Directions
1. Combine garam masala, paprika, red chile pepper or flakes, and black pepper in a bowl. Cover and set aside for at least 2 hours.
2. Peel garlic and ginger, and mash into a paste with the salt.
3. In a dutch oven or large pot with a lot, heat oil over high.
4. Add ginger/garlic paste, stirring to keep it from burning.
5. When fragrant (1-2 minutes), add meat and sear lightly, but realize it'll be difficult to do without burning the garlic / ginger paste, so don't worry too much.
6. Add fish sauce and water, scraping up any brown bits that may be stuck to the pan.
7. Turn down heat so it's at a low simmer and cover the pot, leaving the lid slightly ajar.
8. Stir periodically to avoid burning. If the pot seems very dry, add a tbsp of water and turn the heat down slightly.
9. Simmer and stir for 1-2 hours, until beef is relatively tender. 
9.5 If adding potatoes, add now and give them 10-15 minutes.
10. Add whole peeled shallots and continue a low simmering with the lid ajar.
11. When the shallots and optional ingredients are tender (10-15 minutes), add .25 cup of the fried shallots. If the dish seems too liquidy, add more shallots until arriving at the desired consistency.
12. Ideally, there should be a thin layer of oil over the top of the dish. My family refers to this as "see byan" -- "the oil returns." The idea, if I understand it correctly, was to show off to your guests how much oil you used, as a sign of respect. If you don't see this, use more oil next time.
13. Serve w/ rice or paratha or chapati (see note).



## Notes
* I generally use chuck for this given it's the cheapest beef stew meat I can find, but shank/shin is excellent.
* For the fried shallots, peel and thinly slice shallots. Fry over medium-high heat in an inch or two of the oil. Remove to paper towels or a rack to cool. Note, they cook down and keep a few days, so feel free to make a bunch. 
	* I like to do this the day I'm making the curry so that I can reuse the shallot-flavored oil.
* I generally add a dash of fish sauce to each serving and/or a squeeze of fresh lime juice.
